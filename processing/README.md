# Data processing
Once data has been acquired ([see readme file in acquisition folder](../acquisition/README.md)), it can be processed with the two main Python notebooks presented hereunder.



1. Within the `processing` folder, run `jupyter notebook` this will start a jupyter iPython session accessible through web browsers.
2. Run the `calibration.ipynb` notebook, that should be self-explanatory. The only thing to make sure of is to **set the correct path to load the calibration data**. For best calibration results, when asked to select a region of interest, make sure to include a wide variety of intensities.
3. Run the `reconstruction.ipynb` notebook, again **making sure to set the correct path**.
